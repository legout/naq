### Sub-task: Migrate Connection Patterns in `src/naq/cli/` Module
**Description:** Replace existing NATS connection patterns in the `src/naq/cli/` command files with the new context managers.
**Implementation Steps:**
- For each relevant command file in `src/naq/cli/`:
    - Identify connection patterns.
    - Replace with appropriate context managers.
    - Remove unused imports.
**Success Criteria:**
- All connection patterns in `src/naq/cli/` command files are replaced.
- CLI commands function as expected.
**Testing:**
- Manually test key CLI commands that involve NATS connections (e.g., starting a worker, enqueueing a job via CLI).
- Ensure commands execute successfully and interact with NATS as intended.
**Documentation:**
- Update any internal documentation or comments within the `src/naq/cli/` files.
