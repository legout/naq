### Sub-task: Verify Performance Requirements
**Description:** Evaluate the performance impact of the new connection management system to ensure no regressions and identify any potential improvements.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Compare connection establishment time and memory usage with pre-migration baselines.
- Analyze connection reuse patterns to confirm optimizations are effective.
- Conduct stress tests to verify no connection leaks under various loads.
**Success Criteria:**
- Connection establishment time is not increased.
- Memory usage for connections is not increased.
- Connection reuse optimizations are demonstrably beneficial.
- No connection leaks detected under any circumstances.
**Testing:**
- Run performance benchmarks and load tests.
- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, network connections) during tests.
- Use profiling tools to identify any performance bottlenecks.
**Documentation:**
- Document performance test results and any observed improvements or regressions.
- Add guidance on connection pooling and performance tuning in the advanced documentation (`docs/advanced.qmd`).
