### Sub-task 8: Implement Overall Testing and Performance Verification
**Description:** Conduct comprehensive testing across the entire codebase after service layer integration, focusing on functionality preservation, performance improvements, and consistent error handling.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Execute all existing unit, integration, and scenario tests.
- Develop new integration tests to cover end-to-end flows involving multiple services.
- Conduct performance tests to verify connection pooling benefits and overall system efficiency.
- Review error logs and ensure consistent error handling across services.
**Success Criteria:**
- All existing tests pass without regression.
- New integration tests validate the service layer's functionality.
- Performance tests show improvements (e.g., from connection pooling).
- Consistent error handling is observed across the system.
**Testing:**
- Execute `pytest tests/` to run all tests.
- Implement specific performance benchmarks and run them.
- Conduct manual testing of key features.
**Documentation:**
- Document the results of performance tests and any observed improvements in `docs/architecture.qmd` or a performance report.
