# Sync Function Blocking Issue - Implementation Summary

## Problem Analysis Complete ✅

**Issue**: When multiple jobs are enqueued simultaneously, sync functions block the worker's event loop, preventing concurrent execution even when worker concurrency is set to > 1. Async functions execute properly in parallel.

**Root Cause**: The `Job.execute()` method in `src/naq/job.py` runs sync functions directly in the asyncio event loop thread without yielding control back to the event loop.

## Solution Design Complete ✅

**Fix**: Modify `Job.execute()` to use `asyncio.to_thread()` for sync functions to run them in a separate thread, preventing them from blocking the event loop.

**Benefits**:
1. Non-blocking sync execution
2. True concurrency for multiple sync jobs
3. Backward compatibility
4. Minimal code change (only one method)
5. Preserves existing async function behavior

## Test Case Complete ✅

Created comprehensive test case in `sync_blocking_fix_plan.md` that:
- Reproduces the blocking issue
- Demonstrates async functions work correctly
- Verifies the fix resolves the blocking behavior
- Provides before/after expected results

## Implementation Ready ✅

### Files to Modify:
- `src/naq/job.py` - Line 596-620 (Job.execute method)

### Specific Change:
Replace the sync function execution block:
```python
else:
    self.result = self.function(*self.args, **self.kwargs)  # Current blocking code
```

With:
```python
else:
    # For sync functions, run them in a separate thread to avoid blocking
    # the event loop. This allows true parallel execution when
    # multiple sync jobs are processed concurrently.
    self.result = await asyncio.to_thread(
        self.function, *self.args, **self.kwargs
    )
```

### Testing Strategy:
1. Run the test script to reproduce the issue
2. Apply the fix
3. Run the test script again to verify the fix
4. Run existing tests to ensure no regression
5. Test with both sync and async functions

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Sync jobs: ~10 seconds total (2s × 5 jobs, sequential execution)
- Async jobs: ~2 seconds total (parallel execution)

### After Fix:
- Sync jobs: ~2 seconds total (parallel execution)
- Async jobs: ~2 seconds total (parallel execution)

## Next Steps

Switch to Code mode to implement the fix and run the tests.
