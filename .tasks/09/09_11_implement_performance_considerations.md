### Sub-task 11: Implement Performance Considerations
**Description:** Optimize the service layer for performance, focusing on efficient service initialization, instance reuse, connection sharing, and minimal overhead in hot paths.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Implement lazy service initialization where appropriate within `ServiceManager`.
- Ensure service instances are reused efficiently across components.
- Verify connection sharing mechanisms (e.g., NATS connection pooling) are optimized within `ConnectionService`.
- Analyze hot paths in the codebase to minimize service overhead.
**Success Criteria:**
- Service initialization is optimized.
- Service instances are reused effectively.
- Connection sharing is efficient.
- Service overhead in hot paths is minimal.
**Testing:**
- Conduct performance benchmarks to measure service overhead and compare with baselines.
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network) to identify any inefficiencies.
**Documentation:**
- Document performance optimization strategies and their impact in `docs/advanced.qmd`.
- Provide guidance on configuring for optimal performance.
