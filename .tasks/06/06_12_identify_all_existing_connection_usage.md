### Sub-task: Identify All Existing Connection Usage
**Description:** Systematically identify all occurrences of `get_nats_connection` and `get_jetstream_context` calls, and direct `nats.connect` or `.jetstream()` patterns across the codebase to prepare for migration.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Execute the provided `grep` commands to find all relevant connection patterns:
    - `grep -r "get_nats_connection\|get_jetstream_context" src/naq --exclude-dir=__pycache__ > connection_usage.txt`
    - `grep -r "await.*connect\|\.jetstream\(\)" src/naq --exclude-dir=__pycache__ >> connection_usage.txt`
- Analyze the `connection_usage.txt` file to categorize the patterns (Simple, JetStream, KV Store).
**Success Criteria:**
- A comprehensive `connection_usage.txt` file is generated, listing all identified connection patterns.
- The patterns are categorized for systematic migration.
- All 44+ instances are identified.
**Testing:**
- Manually review a sample of the `connection_usage.txt` to confirm accuracy and completeness.
- Cross-reference with known connection points in the codebase.
**Documentation:**
- No specific documentation updates for this sub-task, but the generated list will inform future migration documentation.
