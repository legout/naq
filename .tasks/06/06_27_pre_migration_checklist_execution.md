### Sub-task: Pre-Migration Checklist Execution
**Description:** Execute the pre-migration checklist to ensure the environment is ready for connection management migration.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Identify all 44+ connection usage locations (already covered by a previous sub-task, but re-verify).
- Create test cases for each connection pattern if not already covered by existing tests.
- Document current error handling behavior for existing connection patterns.
- Establish baseline performance measurements for NATS operations.
**Success Criteria:**
- All pre-migration checklist items are completed.
- A clear understanding of existing connection usage, error handling, and performance baselines is established.
**Testing:**
- Verify that all identified connection patterns have corresponding test cases.
- Confirm that performance baselines are accurately recorded.
**Documentation:**
- Record the findings of the pre-migration checklist, including the list of identified locations, current error handling notes, and performance baselines.
