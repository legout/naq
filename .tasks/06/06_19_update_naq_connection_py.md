### Sub-task: Update `src/naq/connection.py`
**Description:** Integrate the new connection context managers and utilities into the existing `src/naq/connection.py` file, potentially deprecating or removing old connection functions.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Open `src/naq/connection.py`.
- Analyze existing functions (`get_nats_connection`, `get_jetstream_context`, `close_nats_connection`).
- Refactor these functions to use the new context managers internally if they are still needed for backward compatibility or specific use cases.
- Mark old functions as deprecated or remove them if they are no longer used after migration.
- Add imports for the new context managers, utilities, and decorators.
**Success Criteria:**
- `src/naq/connection.py` is updated to leverage the new connection management patterns.
- Old connection functions are either removed or properly integrated/deprecated.
- The file serves as a central point for connection-related functionalities.
**Testing:**
- Run any existing tests that rely on `src/naq/connection.py`.
- Ensure that if old functions are still used, they correctly utilize the new patterns.
**Documentation:**
- Update the docstrings of any modified or deprecated functions in `src/naq/connection.py`.
- Add a note in the overall project documentation about the new centralized connection management.
