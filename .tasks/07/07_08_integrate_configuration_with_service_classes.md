### Sub-task 8: Integrate Configuration with Service Classes
**Description:** Modify existing service classes to consume configuration directly from the new `NAQConfig` object.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Identify all relevant service classes (e.g., `ConnectionService`).
- Update the `__init__` method of these service classes to accept an `NAQConfig` object.
- Replace direct access to `settings.py` or `os.getenv` with access to the properties of the `config` object.
**Success Criteria:**
- Service classes are initialized with and correctly use the `NAQConfig` object.
- Services function correctly with configuration provided via the new system.
**Testing:**
- Create integration tests for key service classes (e.g., `ConnectionService`) to ensure they correctly use the new configuration.
- Verify that changes in the configuration are reflected in service behavior.
**Documentation:**
- Update relevant sections of the architecture documentation to reflect how services now consume configuration.
