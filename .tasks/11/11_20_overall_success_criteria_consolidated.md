### Sub-task 20: Overall Success Criteria (Consolidated)
**Description:** A consolidated set of criteria to determine the overall success of the testing updates and validation task.
**Success Criteria:**
- **Test Coverage:**
    - >95% code coverage for the new service layer.
    - >90% code coverage for refactored modules.
    - All existing functionality is covered by tests.
    - Edge cases and error conditions are thoroughly tested.
- **Compatibility:**
    - All existing user workflows work unchanged.
    - All legacy imports function correctly.
    - No breaking changes are introduced in the public API.
    - Configuration compatibility is maintained.
- **Performance:**
    - No performance regressions are detected.
    - Service layer overhead is less than 10%.
    - Event logging overhead is less than 20%.
    - Memory usage is not significantly increased.
- **Quality:**
    - All tests pass consistently.
    - The entire test suite runs in a reasonable time (<5 minutes).
    - Test organization and documentation are clear and comprehensive.
    - Comprehensive error scenario coverage is achieved.
**Testing:**
- Regular execution of the full test suite (unit, integration, compatibility, performance, CLI).
- Code coverage analysis reports for new and refactored code.
- Performance benchmarking and comparison with baselines.
- Manual verification of key user workflows.
**Documentation:**
- A high-level overview in `README.md` or `OmniQ_Project_Plan.md` summarizing the testing strategy and success of this task.
- Detailed reports on test coverage, performance, and compatibility in relevant documentation files (e.g., `docs/testing.qmd`, `docs/performance.qmd`).
