### Sub-task 16: Implement Performance Regression Tests for Event Logging Overhead
**Description:** Develop performance tests to quantify the impact of event logging on overall system performance, ensuring it does not introduce significant overhead.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Expand `tests/test_performance/test_service_overhead.py` or create `tests/test_performance/test_event_overhead.py`.
- Design tests that compare job execution performance with event logging enabled versus disabled.
- Measure the time taken for a batch of job executions in both scenarios.
- Assert that event logging overhead is less than 20%.
**Success Criteria:**
- Event logging overhead is measured and validated.
- The overhead remains below the specified 20% threshold.
**Testing:**
- Run `pytest tests/test_performance/test_event_overhead.py` (or the relevant test file).
- Analyze performance differences between enabled and disabled event logging.
**Documentation:**
- In `docs/performance.qmd`, document the performance impact of event logging and provide guidance on when to enable/disable it.
