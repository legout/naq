### Sub-task 19: Refine Test Organization and CI/CD Integration
**Description:** Structure the test suite into a logical hierarchy and update CI/CD workflows to include the new test phases, ensuring automated and comprehensive testing.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Organize test files into the proposed `tests/` directory structure: `test_models/`, `test_services/`, `test_integration/`, `test_compatibility/`, `test_performance/`, `test_config/`, `test_cli/`.
- Update the `.github/workflows/test.yml` (or similar CI configuration) to include new test stages for unit, integration, compatibility, and performance tests.
- Ensure the CI pipeline starts a NATS server for integration tests.
- Configure `pip install -e .[dev,test]` for dependency installation in CI.
**Success Criteria:**
- The test directory structure is clear and adheres to the plan.
- The CI/CD pipeline successfully runs all new test categories.
- All tests pass consistently in the CI environment.
- The test suite runs in a reasonable time (<5 minutes).
**Testing:**
- Trigger CI/CD builds and monitor their execution.
- Verify that all test failures are correctly reported and linked to specific code changes.
**Documentation:**
- Update `docs/contributing.qmd` with guidelines on test organization and how to add new tests.
- Document the CI/CD pipeline and its testing stages in `docs/development.qmd` (or similar).
