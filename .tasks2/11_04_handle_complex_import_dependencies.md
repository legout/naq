### Sub-task 4: Handle Complex Import Dependencies
**Description:** Address and prevent circular import issues, particularly when modules depend on each other for type hints, by using `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`. Additionally, implement dynamic imports for optional dependencies where necessary to avoid hard dependencies.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Identify specific files or modules that might create circular import dependencies (e.g., `worker.py` and `queue.py` if they directly import each other's main classes).
- In such cases, use `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING` and place the problematic import statements within an `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block.
- For optional dependencies, implement a dynamic import mechanism using `try-except ImportError` blocks to load modules only if they are available, allowing the application to function without them if they are installed.
**Success Criteria:**
- All identified circular import issues are resolved, and the codebase is free of circular import errors.
- Type hints that previously caused circular imports are now correctly handled using `TYPE_CHECKING`.
- Optional dependencies are loaded dynamically, and the application handles their absence gracefully.
**Testing:**
- Run type checks (`ruff check src/ --select E,F,W`) to ensure all type hints are correctly resolved and no new type-related errors appear.
- Execute the full test suite to confirm the application's functionality, specifically focusing on areas that previously had circular dependencies or relied on optional imports.
- If relevant, run tests in environments with and without optional dependencies installed to verify the dynamic import behavior.
**Documentation:**
- No direct documentation updates are required for this sub-task, as it's a technical implementation detail for code robustness.
- If a new pattern for handling optional dependencies is broadly applicable, consider adding a note to the developer guidelines or an internal architecture document.
