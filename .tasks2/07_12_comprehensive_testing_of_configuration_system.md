### Sub-task 12: Comprehensive Testing of Configuration System
**Description:** Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for the entire configuration system, including loading, validation, integration, and CLI commands. This sub-task consolidates testing efforts mentioned in previous sub-tasks.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Create dedicated test files for `loader.py`, `schema.py`, `__init__.py` (for API), and `merger.py`.
- Implement unit tests for all functions and methods within `src/naq/config/`.
- Implement integration tests to verify:
    - Correct configuration loading priority (YAML > Env Vars > Defaults).
    - Environment variable interpolation.
    - Schema validation and error handling.
    - Backward compatibility with existing environment variables in `settings.py`.
    - Service classes correctly consuming the new configuration.
    - Functionality of CLI configuration commands (`config`, `generate_config`).
    - Hot-reloading behavior.
- Ensure test coverage is high for the new `src/naq/config` module.
**Success Criteria:**
- All planned tests are implemented and pass.
- Test coverage for the new configuration module is comprehensive.
- No regressions are introduced to existing functionality due to configuration changes.
**Testing:**
- Execute all newly created unit and integration tests.
- Use a code coverage tool to ensure high coverage of the new configuration system.
**Documentation:**
- Document the testing strategy and any special test utilities (e.g., `temp_config_file`, `env_override`) used for configuration testing.
