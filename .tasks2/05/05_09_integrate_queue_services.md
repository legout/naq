### Sub-task: Integrate Services into `src/naq/queue/`
**Description:** Refactor the `Queue` class and related components to utilize the new centralized service layer, replacing direct NATS interactions and other duplicated logic with service calls.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Identify all files in `src/naq/queue/` that interact with NATS, JetStream, or KV stores directly.
- Update these files to use `ServiceManager` and inject `ConnectionService`, `StreamService`, `KVStoreService`, `JobService`, and `EventService` as needed.
- Replace direct `get_nats_connection()` and similar calls with service calls.
**Success Criteria:**
- All NATS and related resource interactions in `src/naq/queue/` are handled by the service layer.
- Code duplication in `src/naq/queue/` related to connections and resource management is eliminated.
- The `Queue` class functions correctly with the new service integration.
**Testing:**
- Run existing unit and integration tests for `src/naq/queue/` to ensure no regression.
- Create new integration tests specifically for `Queue`'s interaction with the service layer.
**Documentation:**
- Update relevant sections of the documentation describing the `Queue` class to reflect its reliance on the new service layer.
