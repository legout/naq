### Sub-task 12: Implement Migration Validation
**Description:** Implement comprehensive migration validation steps, including pre-integration and post-integration checklists, to ensure the successful and robust transition to the service layer.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Implement pre-integration checklist items:
    - Verify all services are implemented and tested.
    - Confirm configuration system is working.
    - Ensure common patterns are extracted.
    - Record performance benchmarks.
- Implement post-integration checklist items:
    - Verify all components use the service layer.
    - Confirm no direct NATS operations outside services.
    - Validate configuration is passed correctly.
    - Ensure all tests pass.
    - Verify performance meets or exceeds benchmarks.
    - Confirm resource cleanup is working.
**Success Criteria:**
- All pre-integration checklist items are completed before integration.
- All post-integration checklist items are completed after integration.
- Migration is validated, confirming functional correctness, performance, and stability.
**Testing:**
- Execute all unit, integration, and scenario tests.
- Run performance benchmarks and load tests.
- Perform manual functional tests for critical paths.
**Documentation:**
- Document the pre- and post-migration checklists in `docs/architecture.qmd` or a dedicated migration guide.
- Summarize the results of the migration validation.
