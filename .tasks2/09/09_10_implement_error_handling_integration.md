### Sub-task 10: Implement Error Handling Integration
**Description:** Ensure consistent error handling and propagation through the service layer, maintaining backward compatibility for existing exception types and ensuring clear error messages.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Define or ensure the existence of NAQ-specific exceptions (e.g., `NaqException`, `NaqConnectionError`, `JobExecutionError`, `JobNotFoundError`, `SerializationError`, `ConfigurationError`).
- Within service methods, catch lower-level exceptions and re-raise them as appropriate NAQ-specific exceptions, preserving the original error chain.
- Ensure error context (e.g., operation name, job ID) is preserved and logged.
- Verify that existing error messages and exception types remain consistent from a user's perspective.
**Success Criteria:**
- All service methods correctly raise NAQ-specific exceptions for relevant error conditions.
- Error context is consistently preserved and propagated.
- No breaking changes are introduced to existing exception types or error messages.
**Testing:**
- Unit tests for service methods to verify correct exception raising and error chaining.
- Integration tests to simulate error conditions and ensure proper error handling and logging across service boundaries.
- Compatibility tests to confirm existing error handling mechanisms still function as expected.
**Documentation:**
- Update the error handling section of the documentation (e.g., `docs/advanced.qmd` or `docs/api/exceptions.qmd`) to describe the new error propagation strategy and the types of exceptions users might encounter.
- Provide examples of how to handle NAQ-specific exceptions.
