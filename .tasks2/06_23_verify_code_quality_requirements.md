### Sub-task: Verify Code Quality Requirements
**Description:** Ensure the code quality of the new connection management system meets defined standards, focusing on maintainability, readability, and consistency.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Conduct a code review to confirm:
    - No duplicate connection management code.
    - Consistent patterns across all modules using context managers.
    - Clear and intuitive context manager interfaces.
    - Comprehensive error handling.
    - Connection monitoring and metrics are correctly implemented and accessible.
- Run linting and static analysis tools.
**Success Criteria:**
- No duplicate connection management code.
- Consistent patterns across all modules.
- Clear context manager interfaces.
- Comprehensive error handling.
- Connection monitoring and metrics are functional.
**Testing:**
- Perform static code analysis (linting, type checking).
- Manual code review by another developer.
**Documentation:**
- Ensure all new code has clear docstrings and comments.
- Update `AGENTS.md` or similar internal development guidelines if new best practices emerge from this task.
