### Sub-task 8: Implement Overall Documentation for Event System
**Description:** Create comprehensive documentation for the event system, including its architecture, event types, usage in components, CLI commands, performance considerations, and custom processing.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Update `docs/architecture.qmd` with a detailed overview of the event system's design, event flow, and how it integrates with different NAQ components.
- Add a new section or update existing ones in `docs/api/events.qmd` to describe all event types (Job, Worker, Scheduler, System Events), their data fields, and their triggers.
- Provide clear usage examples in `docs/examples.qmd` for event logging, streaming, and querying.
- Document the new CLI event monitoring commands in `docs/quickstart.qmd` or a dedicated CLI section.
- Detail performance optimization strategies and configuration parameters in `docs/advanced.qmd`.
- Explain how to implement and register custom event processors.
**Success Criteria:**
- The event system documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and easy to understand.
- All event-related features are well-documented.
- Users can effectively use and extend the event system based on the provided documentation.
**Testing:**
- Review the updated documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
- Verify that all code examples are correct and runnable.
**Documentation:**
- This sub-task is primarily about documentation, so the output is the updated documentation itself.
