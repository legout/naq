### Sub-task 11: Implement Model Tests
**Description:** Create unit tests for the `Job` and `Event` models, ensuring their creation, serialization, deserialization, and execution (for Job) work correctly after refactoring.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Create `tests/test_models/test_jobs.py` to test `Job` and `JobResult` creation, serialization, deserialization, and `execute` method.
- Create `tests/test_models/test_events.py` to test `JobEvent` and `WorkerEvent` creation using factory methods and their serialization (`to_dict`).
- Ensure these tests cover various states and properties of the models.
**Success Criteria:**
- `Job` and `JobResult` models can be created, serialized, deserialized, and executed correctly.
- `JobEvent` and `WorkerEvent` models can be created and converted to dictionaries accurately.
- All model tests pass consistently.
**Testing:**
- Run `pytest tests/test_models/test_jobs.py` and `pytest tests/test_models/test_events.py`.
**Documentation:**
- Ensure docstrings for `Job`, `JobResult`, `JobEvent`, and `WorkerEvent` models are up-to-date and reflect their current structure and usage. (Located in `src/naq/models/jobs.py` and `src/naq/models/events.py`.)
