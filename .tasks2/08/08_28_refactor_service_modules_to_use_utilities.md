### Sub-task: Refactor Service Modules to Use Utilities
**Description:** Replace repeated code patterns in the `src/naq/services/` modules with the newly created utility functions and decorators.
**Implementation Steps:**
- For each file in `src/naq/services/`:
    - Apply `retry`, `timing`, and `log_errors` decorators where appropriate.
    - Replace manual error handling with `ErrorHandler` and `wrap_naq_exception`.
    - Replace direct logging with `StructuredLogger` and `operation_context`.
    - Replace manual serialization/deserialization with `SerializationHelper` and `serialize_with_metadata`/`deserialize_with_metadata`.
    - Replace validation logic with `validation.py` utilities.
    - Replace NATS operations with `nats_helpers.py` utilities (if applicable).
    - Ensure `BaseService` integrates with `StructuredLogger` and `ErrorHandler` for consistent behavior across all services.
**Success Criteria:**
- Code in `src/naq/services/` is refactored to use common utilities.
- Reduced code duplication in `src/naq/services/`.
- Functionality of service modules remains unchanged.
**Testing:**
- Run all existing unit and integration tests for the `services` module.
- Verify that error handling, logging, and serialization work as expected after refactoring.
**Documentation:**
- Update any internal documentation or comments within the `src/naq/services/` files to reflect the new utility usage.
