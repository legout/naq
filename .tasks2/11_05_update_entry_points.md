### Sub-task 5: Update Entry Points
**Description:** Update the project's entry points, specifically in `pyproject.toml`, to reflect the new location of the main CLI application. This ensures that the `naq` command correctly invokes the application.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Modify the `[project.scripts]` section in `pyproject.toml` to set the `naq` entry point to `naq.cli:main`. (Assuming `naq.cli` will expose the `main` function directly from its `__init__.py` or a `main.py` module within the `cli` package as specified in the original task).
- Check for the existence of `setup.py`. If it exists, update any corresponding entry points within it to match the new `naq.cli:main` path.
**Success Criteria:**
- The `naq` command, when executed from the terminal, successfully launches the application's command-line interface.
- `pyproject.toml` correctly references the new CLI entry point.
**Testing:**
- Run a simple CLI command (e.g., `naq --version` or `naq --help`) from the terminal to verify the entry point is correctly configured and the application starts.
- If there are automated tests for the CLI, execute them to ensure full functionality.
**Documentation:**
- Update any installation or quickstart guides (e.g., `docs/installation.qmd`, `docs/quickstart.qmd`) that refer to running the `naq` CLI command, ensuring the instructions are consistent with the updated entry point.
