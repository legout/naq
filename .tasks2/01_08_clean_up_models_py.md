### Sub-task 8: Clean Up Original `models.py`
**Description:** The final sub-task is to remove the original, monolithic `models.py` file, completing the refactor.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Delete the file `src/naq/models.py`.
- Run a final check to ensure that no internal code was still referencing the old file.
**Success Criteria:**
- The file `src/naq/models.py` is successfully deleted.
- The project remains fully functional and all tests pass.
**Testing:** Run the full test suite one last time to confirm that the removal of the old file did not cause any issues.
**Documentation:** Ensure that any references to `src/naq/models.py` in architectural diagrams or other documentation are updated to reflect the new package structure.
