### Sub-task 14: Implement Configuration Utilities (merger.py and validator.py)
**Description:** Implement helper utilities for merging and validating configuration data.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Ensure `merger.py` (Sub-task 6) is fully implemented.
- Ensure `validator.py` (Sub-task 3) is fully implemented.
- These files are implicitly covered by other sub-tasks but are explicitly listed as files to create, so this sub-task ensures their completion as standalone modules if not already fully addressed.
**Success Criteria:**
- Both `merger.py` and `validator.py` files exist and contain their respective logic.
- The functions within these modules are robust and correctly perform their merging and validation tasks.
**Testing:**
- Ensure unit tests for `merger.py` and `validator.py` are comprehensive.
**Documentation:**
- Provide clear docstrings for all functions and classes within `merger.py` and `validator.py`.
