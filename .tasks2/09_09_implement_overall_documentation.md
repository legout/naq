### Sub-task 9: Implement Overall Documentation
**Description:** Update the project documentation to reflect the new service layer architecture, its benefits, and usage patterns.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Update `docs/architecture.qmd` with a detailed overview of the service layer, its components, and their relationships.
- Add a new section or update existing ones in `docs/examples.qmd` with usage examples for each service.
- Review and update any other documentation files that might be affected by the service layer introduction (e.g., `docs/quickstart.qmd`, `docs/contributing.qmd`).
**Success Criteria:**
- The documentation accurately describes the service layer.
- Usage examples are clear and up-to-date.
- Developers can easily understand and use the new service layer based on the documentation.
**Testing:**
- Review all updated documentation files for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
**Documentation:**
- This sub-task is primarily about documentation, so the output is the updated documentation itself.
