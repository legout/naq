### Sub-task 21: Implement Test Execution Strategy (Consolidated)
**Description:** A unified strategy for executing tests, integrating them into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Implement a phased automated testing pipeline:
    1. Unit Tests (fast, isolated)
    2. Integration Tests (component interactions)
    3. Compatibility Tests (backward compatibility)
    4. Performance Tests (regression checking)
    5. End-to-End Tests (full workflow validation)
- Maintain the specified test organization within the `tests/` directory.
- Integrate the testing pipeline into CI/CD workflows (e.g., `.github/workflows/test.yml`) to run on push and pull requests across multiple Python versions (3.12, 3.13).
- Ensure a NATS server is started as part of the CI/CD test environment.
**Success Criteria:**
- The automated testing pipeline is fully implemented and operational.
- Tests are executed consistently in CI/CD.
- Different test types are run in the correct order.
**Testing:**
- Monitor CI/CD runs for successful execution of all test phases.
- Verify that test failures are correctly reported and linked to specific code changes.
**Documentation:**
- Document the test execution strategy and CI/CD integration in `docs/development.qmd` or `docs/contributing.qmd`.
- Provide instructions on how to run tests locally.
