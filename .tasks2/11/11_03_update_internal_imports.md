### Sub-task 3: Update Internal Imports
**Description:** Systematically update all internal import statements across the `src/naq/` codebase to use the new modular structure, replacing old `from .` and `from naq.` imports with their new, more specific paths.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Systematically traverse **all** `.py` files within the `src/naq/` directory and its subdirectories.
- For each file, identify and replace imports like `from .models import X` with `from .models.sub_module import X` (e.g., `from naq.models.jobs import Job`).
- Replace `from .queue import X` with `from .queue.sub_module import X` (e.g., `from naq.queue.core import Queue`, `from naq.queue.async_api import enqueue`).
- Replace `from .worker import X` with `from .worker.sub_module import X` (e.g., `from naq.worker.core import Worker`).
- Replace `from .serializers import X` with `from .services.serialization import X`.
- Ensure other internal imports are updated to point to the correct new locations (e.g., `from naq.connection import ...` from `naq.connection.context_managers`).
- Perform file-by-file updates, ensuring each file remains functional after modification.
**Success Criteria:**
- All internal imports within `src/naq/` and its subdirectories are updated to the new modular structure.
- The entire codebase compiles and runs without any import errors or unresolved references.
- No new circular import issues are introduced as a result of these changes.
**Testing:**
- Run unit tests for each modified file immediately after updating its imports to ensure localized functionality.
- Execute the entire test suite (`pytest tests/`) to catch any integration issues or regressions caused by the import changes.
- Perform static analysis (e.g., `ruff check src/`) to identify any remaining incorrect imports or potential circular dependencies.
**Documentation:**
- No direct end-user documentation updates are required for this sub-task, as it's an internal code restructuring.
- However, ensure that any code examples or references within docstrings of the modified files reflect the new internal import patterns where applicable.
