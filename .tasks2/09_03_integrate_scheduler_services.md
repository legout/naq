### Sub-task 3: Integrate Services into `src/naq/scheduler.py`
**Description:** Refactor the `Scheduler` class to utilize the new centralized service layer, abstracting NATS interactions and scheduled job management through service calls.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Update `src/naq/scheduler.py` to use `ServiceManager` and inject `ConnectionService`, `KVStoreService`, `EventService`, and `SchedulerService` as needed.
- Replace direct NATS calls and scheduled job logic with service calls.
**Success Criteria:**
- All NATS and related resource interactions in `src/naq/scheduler.py` are handled by the service layer.
- Code duplication in `src/naq/scheduler.py` related to connections and resource management is eliminated.
- The `Scheduler` class functions correctly with the new service integration.
**Testing:**
- Run existing unit and integration tests for `src/naq/scheduler.py` to ensure no regression.
- Create new integration tests specifically for `Scheduler`'s interaction with the service layer.
**Documentation:**
- Update relevant sections of the documentation describing the `Scheduler` class to reflect its reliance on the new service layer.
