### Sub-task 5: Integrate Services into Event System
**Description:** Refactor the event system components to utilize the new centralized service layer for NATS interactions and event storage, ensuring consistent behavior and leveraging service benefits.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Identify all relevant files in `src/naq/events/` (e.g., `logger.py`, `processor.py`) that interact with NATS directly.
- Update these files to use `ServiceManager` and inject `ConnectionService`, `StreamService`, and `EventService` as needed.
- Replace direct NATS calls for event publishing/consuming with service calls.
**Success Criteria:**
- All NATS interactions within the event system are handled by the service layer.
- Event publishing and consumption remain functional and consistent.
**Testing:**
- Run existing unit and integration tests for the event system.
- Verify that event logging and processing work correctly after service integration.
**Documentation:**
- Update relevant sections of the documentation describing the event system to reflect its reliance on the new service layer.
