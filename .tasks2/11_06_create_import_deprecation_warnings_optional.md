### Sub-task 6: Create Import Deprecation Warnings (Optional)
**Description:** (Optional) Implement deprecation warnings for legacy import paths to guide users towards the new modular structure. This provides a clear migration path and informs users that old imports will be removed in future versions (e.g., 1.0.0).
**Implementation Steps:**
- Define a utility function, `deprecated_import_warning(old_path: str, new_path: str)`, that issues a `DeprecationWarning` with a clear message including the old and new import paths and the planned removal version.
- In key legacy import locations (e.g., `src/naq/__init__.py` for top-level imports like `Job`, or `src/naq/models/__init__.py` for model imports), introduce logic to issue this warning. This can be done by:
    - Subclassing the newly imported class (e.g., `Job` from `naq.models.jobs`) within the legacy `__init__.py` and issuing the warning upon instantiation of the legacy class.
    - Using import hooks or other mechanisms to trigger the warning when the legacy path is accessed directly by user code, ensuring internal usage does not trigger warnings.
**Success Criteria:**
- When a user imports from a legacy path (e.g., `from naq import Job`), a `DeprecationWarning` is issued.
- The warning message clearly informs the user about the deprecated path, the new recommended path, and the future removal.
- Internal usage of the now-modularized components does not trigger deprecation warnings.
**Testing:**
- Write specific unit tests that deliberately import from the deprecated paths and assert that a `DeprecationWarning` is raised.
- Run the main test suite with deprecation warnings enabled to ensure no unintended warnings are generated by the internal codebase.
**Documentation:**
- Add a dedicated section to the "Import Migration Guide" (being drafted in Sub-task 1) detailing the deprecated imports, the exact warning message, and explicit instructions on how users should update their code.
- Update any relevant API documentation to clearly mark deprecated imports and provide alternatives.
