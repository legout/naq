### Sub-task: Integration with Service Layer (Task 05)
**Description:** Ensure the new connection management patterns can be seamlessly integrated with the Service Layer (from Task 05), if applicable, for advanced connection pooling and management.
**Implementation Steps:**
- If Task 05 (Service Layer) is already implemented, ensure `ConnectionService` can utilize the new context managers.
- Adapt `ConnectionService` to use `nats_connection`, `jetstream_context`, etc., internally for automatic pooling and management.
**Success Criteria:**
- `ConnectionService` (if implemented) effectively uses the new context managers.
- Advanced connection pooling and management through the service layer is functional.
**Testing:**
- Run integration tests that involve the Service Layer and NATS connections.
- Verify that connections are pooled and managed as expected through the service.
**Documentation:**
- Document how the new connection managers integrate with the Service Layer.
