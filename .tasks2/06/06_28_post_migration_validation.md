### Sub-task: Post-Migration Validation
**Description:** Execute the post-migration checklist to validate the success of the connection management migration.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Verify that all connection patterns have been successfully migrated.
- Ensure all existing tests pass without modification.
- Confirm no performance regressions (covered by "Verify Performance Requirements").
- Verify no memory leaks are detected.
- Validate that error handling behavior remains consistent or improved.
- Confirm connection monitoring shows healthy patterns.
**Success Criteria:**
- All post-migration checklist items are completed.
- The migration is fully validated, confirming functional correctness, performance, and stability.
**Testing:**
- Run the full test suite (unit, integration, load).
- Perform memory profiling and leak detection.
- Monitor connection metrics through the `ConnectionMonitor`.
**Documentation:**
- Document the results of the post-migration validation, noting any deviations or unexpected behaviors.
- Summarize the overall success of the migration.
