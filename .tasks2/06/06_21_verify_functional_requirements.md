### Sub-task: Verify Functional Requirements
**Description:** Ensure that all functional requirements for the new connection management system are met after migration.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Verify that all 44+ connection patterns identified in the "Identify All Existing Connection Usage" sub-task have been replaced.
- Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to confirm no functional regressions have been introduced.
- Confirm consistent error handling across all modules using the new connection patterns.
- Validate that context managers correctly ensure resource cleanup.
- Test that all connection parameters are driven by the centralized configuration.
**Success Criteria:**
- All 44+ connection patterns are replaced.
- No functional regressions detected.
- Consistent error handling confirmed.
- Proper resource cleanup verified.
- Configuration-driven parameters are in effect.
**Testing:**
- Execute the full suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Perform manual functional tests for critical paths and common use cases.
- Review logs for any unhandled connection-related errors.
**Documentation:**
- Update the project's architecture documentation (`docs/architecture.qmd`) to reflect the new connection management design.
- Document any changes in error handling patterns if applicable.
