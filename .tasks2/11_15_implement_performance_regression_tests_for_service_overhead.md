### Sub-task 15: Implement Performance Regression Tests for Service Layer Overhead
**Description:** Create performance tests to measure the overhead introduced by the new service layer, ensuring it remains within acceptable limits.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Create `tests/test_performance/test_service_overhead.py`.
- Design a test that measures the time taken to enqueue and/or process a significant number of jobs using the `ServiceManager`.
- Compare this performance against a baseline (if available, or a theoretical minimal overhead).
- Assert that the service layer overhead is less than 10%.
- Use `time.perf_counter()` for accurate measurements.
**Success Criteria:**
- Service layer overhead is measured and validated.
- The overhead remains below the specified 10% threshold.
- The test runs in a reasonable amount of time.
**Testing:**
- Run `pytest tests/test_performance/test_service_overhead.py`.
- Analyze test results for performance metrics.
**Documentation:**
- In `docs/performance.qmd` (if exists, or create one), document the performance characteristics of the service layer and the methodology for measuring its overhead.
