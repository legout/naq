### Sub-task 11: Implement Backward Compatibility Tests for User Workflows
**Description:** Develop tests to verify that common user workflows (synchronous and asynchronous job enqueuing, worker processing) continue to function identically with the new service layer integration.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Create `tests/test_compatibility/test_user_workflows.py`.
- Write tests for basic synchronous workflows using `enqueue_sync`.
- Write tests for basic asynchronous workflows using `enqueue` and `Queue`.
- Include tests for advanced user workflows that might directly use `Queue`, `Worker`, or `AsyncJobEventLogger`.
- Ensure that the tests validate the end-to-end functionality as perceived by the user.
**Success Criteria:**
- Basic synchronous and asynchronous job processing workflows work as before.
- Advanced user patterns involving direct component usage remain functional.
- All user workflow compatibility tests pass.
**Testing:**
- Run `pytest tests/test_compatibility/test_user_workflows.py`.
- Verify the complete job lifecycle (enqueue, process, result) in these tests.
**Documentation:**
- Update `docs/examples.qmd` or `docs/quickstart.qmd` to confirm that existing examples still work without modification.
