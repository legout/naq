### Sub-task: Implement Service Integration Testing
**Description:** Develop integration tests to validate cross-service communication, dependency injection, and overall service lifecycle management within the ServiceManager.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Create `tests/test_services/test_service_manager.py` to test the ServiceManager's initialization, service retrieval, and dependency injection mechanisms.
- Write tests that simulate interactions between multiple services (e.g., `JobService` using `ConnectionService` and `EventService`).
- Validate that services correctly receive and utilize their injected dependencies.
- Test the full lifecycle of services within the ServiceManager (initialization, operation, cleanup).
**Success Criteria:**
- `test_service_manager.py` successfully validates ServiceManager's core functionalities.
- Tests demonstrate correct data flow and interaction between interdependent services.
- Service lifecycle (init/cleanup) is properly managed and tested.
- All service integration tests pass consistently.
**Testing:**
- Execute integration tests using `pytest tests/test_services/test_service_manager.py` and potentially other integration test files created in this phase.
- Verify that the tests correctly identify any issues with service interaction or dependency injection.
**Documentation:**
- Update `docs/architecture.qmd` to describe the ServiceManager's role and how services interact.
- Add a new section or expand an existing one in `docs/testing.qmd` on writing service integration tests.
