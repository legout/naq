### Sub-task 11: Implement Hot-Reloading Support
**Description:** Enable the configuration system to support hot-reloading of configuration changes.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Review the `reload_config` function in `config/__init__.py` and ensure it effectively clears the cached configuration and reloads from source.
- Determine if any additional mechanisms are needed for hot-reloading (e.g., watching file changes, signaling services to re-read config). The current task description implies that `reload_config` is sufficient, but if not, this sub-task would encompass further implementation.
**Success Criteria:**
- Calling `reload_config` causes the system to re-read and apply the latest configuration.
- Services that depend on configuration can dynamically update their behavior after a reload (if applicable).
**Testing:**
- Create integration tests to simulate configuration changes (e.g., modifying a config file, then calling `reload_config`) and verify that services or parts of the system reflect these changes.
**Documentation:**
- Document the hot-reloading capability and how to trigger a configuration reload.
