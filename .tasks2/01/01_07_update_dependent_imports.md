### Sub-task 7: Update Dependent Imports
**Description:** This sub-task involves identifying all files in the codebase that import from `naq.models` and ensuring they continue to function correctly after the refactor.
**Implementation Steps:**
- Perform a global search for the string `from naq.models` to find all dependent files.
- The primary goal is to ensure these files still work without changes due to the backward-compatible `__init__.py`.
- If any direct imports from the old `models.py` are found (`from naq import models`), they should be updated to use the new structure if necessary, although the goal is to avoid this.
**Success Criteria:**
- All files that previously imported from `naq.models` continue to function without modification.
- The entire test suite passes without any new failures.
**Testing:** Run the full test suite for the entire project to ensure that the refactoring has not introduced any regressions.
**Documentation:** No documentation updates are required for this sub-task, as the changes should be transparent to consumers of the library.
