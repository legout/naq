### Sub-task: Create Public API in __init__.py and Cleanup
**Description:** Configure the `src/naq/worker/__init__.py` file to provide a backward-compatible public API. Then, remove the old `worker.py` file and verify that all imports in the project still work.
**Implementation Steps:**
- In `src/naq/worker/__init__.py`, import the `Worker`, `WorkerStatusManager`, `JobStatusManager`, and `FailedJobHandler` classes from their respective modules.
- Define `__all__` to export the class names, ensuring backward compatibility.
- Delete the original `src/naq/worker.py` file.
- Search the codebase (e.g., in `src/naq/cli/` and `tests/`) for any code that imports from `naq.worker` and ensure it continues to function correctly.
**Success Criteria:**
- `from naq.worker import Worker` works as before.
- All manager classes are accessible via the `naq.worker` package if needed.
- The old `src/naq/worker.py` file is removed.
- All existing tests that rely on worker imports pass without modification.
**Testing:** Run the full test suite to confirm that backward compatibility is maintained and there are no regressions. Pay special attention to tests related to worker instantiation and usage.
**Documentation:** Update the project's architecture documentation to reflect the new `worker` package structure. Ensure the API documentation for the `worker` module is correctly generated.
