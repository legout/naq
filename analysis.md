#Analysis

Based on the code, here is how naq currently handles status:

1. Job Status

* Representation: The Job class in src/naq/models.py has a status property that derives the job's
    state (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED) based on its internal timestamps (_start_time,
    _finish_time) and error attribute.
* Storage & Flow:
    1. A Job object is created and serialized.
    2. It's published to a NATS JetStream stream (naq_jobs) on a subject corresponding to its queue
        (e.g., naq.queue.default). At this point, its status is implicitly QUEUED.
    3. A Worker fetches the message, deserializes the Job, and executes it. The status becomes
        RUNNING.
    4. Upon completion, the status becomes COMPLETED or FAILED.

2. Result Status

* Representation: The final status (COMPLETED or FAILED) is stored as part of the result payload.
* Storage: The Results class in src/naq/results.py manages storing job outcomes in a dedicated NATS
    Key-Value (KV) store named naq_results. The key is the job_id. This provides a persistent record
    of the final state and return value/error.

3. Schedule Status

* Representation: Scheduled jobs have a status field (ACTIVE, PAUSED).
* Storage: The ScheduledJobManager (inside src/naq/queue.py) uses a NATS KV store named
    naq_scheduled_jobs to store the configuration for scheduled and recurring jobs. The Scheduler
    process polls this KV store, and the status field determines if a job should be processed.

4. Worker Status

* Representation: The WorkerStatusManager in src/naq/worker.py defines worker states like STARTING,
    IDLE, BUSY, STOPPING.
* Storage: Each worker periodically writes its status to a NATS KV store named naq_workers. The key
    is the unique worker_id. This acts as a heartbeat, allowing for monitoring of active workers. The
    naq list-workers CLI command would read from this KV store.

Evaluation and Implementation Proposal

Your idea to manage all states using NATS is not just goodâ€”it's precisely the right architecture
for this system, and naq is already implementing it. The current design correctly leverages
different NATS features (Streams for queues, KV for state/results) for their intended purposes.

However, we can formalize and enhance this to make it even more powerful and observable. The key is
to think in terms of events.

Here is a proposed implementation plan to solidify this architecture:

1. Formalize State Management with a Central Event Stream

Instead of just storing the current state, we should publish events for every state transition.
This creates an immutable audit log of everything that happens in the system.

* Action: Create a new, dedicated JetStream stream, e.g., naq_events. This stream will capture
    events from all parts of the system.
* Data Model: Use a structured event model like the JobEvent class already present in
    src/naq/models.py. This is perfect. It captures the event type, job ID, worker ID, timestamps, and
    other metadata.
* Implementation:
    * Worker: Modify the Worker to publish events to the naq_events stream at each stage of
        processing a job:
        * When a job is picked up -> JobEventType.STARTED
        * When a job completes successfully -> JobEventType.COMPLETED
        * When a job fails -> JobEventType.FAILED
        * When a retry is scheduled -> JobEventType.RETRY_SCHEDULED
    * Queue: The Queue.enqueue method should publish a JobEventType.ENQUEUED event.
    * Scheduler: The Scheduler should publish:
        * JobEventType.SCHEDULED when a new job is scheduled.
        * JobEventType.SCHEDULE_TRIGGERED when it enqueues a job that was due.

2. Refine Worker Status with a KV Store

The current heartbeat mechanism is good. We can formalize it to be more explicit.

* Action: Continue using the naq_workers KV store as the single source of truth for the current
    state of each worker.
* Implementation: The WorkerStatusManager is already doing this well. The heartbeat task
    periodically updates the worker's entry in the KV store with its current status (idle, busy), the
    job it's working on, and a recent timestamp. This allows for:
    * Fast Lookups: naq list-workers can simply list the keys in the naq_workers KV store.
    * Dead Worker Detection: A separate monitoring process can scan the KV store for workers whose
        timestamp is older than a defined TTL, indicating they have died without unregistering.

3. Solidify Scheduled Job State

The current use of a KV store for scheduled jobs is correct.

* Action: Continue using the naq_scheduled_jobs KV store.
* Implementation: The ScheduledJobManager already provides methods to pause, resume, and cancel jobs
    by updating their status field within the KV store. This is a robust pattern. When the Scheduler
    emits events (SCHEDULED, SCHEDULE_TRIGGERED), it enriches the central event log.

Summary of Recommendations

1. Centralize Auditing with an Event Stream: Create and use a single naq_events JetStream stream for
    all lifecycle events. This provides unparalleled observability for debugging and monitoring. The
    existing JobEvent model is the perfect schema for these messages.
2. Use KV Stores for Current State: Continue using NATS KV stores (naq_workers, naq_scheduled_jobs,
    naq_results) as the canonical source for the current state of workers, schedules, and job results.
    This is efficient for lookups.
3. Integrate Event Logging: Modify the Worker, Queue, and Scheduler to publish the appropriate
    JobEvent to the naq_events stream at every key transition point. The events/logger.py file seems
    to be a great starting point for this.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds:
* Real-time, queryable current state via KV stores.
* A complete, historical audit trail via the event stream.

This is a very solid foundation for a distributed task queue.
